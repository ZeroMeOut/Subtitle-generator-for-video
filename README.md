# Subtitle-generator-for-video
 
A subtitle generator that runs on local machine (you still need to connect to the internet tho)

A requirements.txt file would be added later

Use "streamlit run app.py" in the directory to start the app

There is a small demo:

# Some problems to note

First, it would show an error if the two chosen languages are the same. I would figure out a way to conter this later.

Secondly depending on your region, some translators may not work (Looking at you Google cuz I'm in China rn). Also for some reason Baidu is acting so so and throws some error. Bing is the most consistent.
